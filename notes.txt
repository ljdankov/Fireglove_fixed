Solenoid Coil specs:
Description : 1/4inch DC 12V 2 Way Normally Closed Pneumatic Aluminum Electric Solenoid Air ValveWIC Valve 2ACK series 2-way normally closed solenoid valve is to control On/Off of air and inert gas. This solenoid valve has one 1/4" inch NPT inlet and one 1/4" inch NPT outlet port. Valve stays close when the coil is de-energized, and it opens when energized. Has two holes in the bottom and can be mounted in any position. Comes with a ED 100% encapsulated coil which suitable to operate in continuous service and constant energized. 2ACK Series valve is a Zero differential solenoid valve which can be operated at 0 PSI (Vacuum). WIC Valve is compatible with SMC valves.

Shape of solenoid burst:
So, this funny graph deserves some explanation:
The solenoid *kinda can be PWM controlled with values from 0->255 from the Arduino 8-bit DAC
It requires an initial high PWM value (near full val of 220 - 255) to initially open the valve.
After the valve is opened (B), the PWM can be scaled back to a lower value (C) and still be held partially open 
It can then be ramped up to the desired value from ( C->D ) which is the Max value used for this burst.
The time period from C->D is ramping up the butane flow based on the acceleration of the gas to allow a slow start for ignition.
The time period from A->C (eInitialOpen) can probably be fairly short (20mS - 25mS according to specs of the solenoid response time)
The solenoid PWM value is then held at level D/E until the burst period is over and then dropped down to 0 (F)

Another potential control method of the gas is simply a slower PWM of the solenoid since this is more reliable than 
controlling the position of the valve By choosing the on/off times of a slower-rate PWM. We've got to determine the maximum practical speed
that we can reliably open and close the solenoid valve. 

We're trying to also achieve fast (100 ms +) flame bursts

So:
The specs of the solenoid say 15-25ms , 
To test the max speed of this, I can disable the ignitor, and use only the solenoid valve
I can make the speed of the 50/50 on /off time be controlled by the pot.
